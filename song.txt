Paranoia is in bloomThe PR transmissions will resumeThey'll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed downAnd hope that we will never see the truth around(So come on)Another promise, another sceneAnother packaged lie to keep us trapped in greedAnd all the green belts wrapped around our mindsAnd endless red tape to keep the truth confined(So come on)They will not force usThey will stop degrading usThey will not control usWe will be victorious(So come on)
